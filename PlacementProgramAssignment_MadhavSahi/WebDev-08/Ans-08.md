Q.8 Create a Counter Web App using React

- Develop a web application using React that functions as a counter.
- Include two buttons in the UI:
    1. "Increment" button:
        - On clicking this button, the counter value should be incremented by one.
    2. "Decrement" button:
        - On clicking this button, the counter value should be decremented by one.
- Implement the counter logic using React's state management.
- Ensure that the counter value is displayed in the UI and updates in real-time when incremented or decremented.
- Use appropriate React components and hooks to manage the counter state and handle button click events.
