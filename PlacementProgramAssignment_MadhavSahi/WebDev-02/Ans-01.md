// Q.1 What’s Box Model in CSS ? 

//Solution--->

The box model is a foundational concept in CSS that outlines the rendering of elements within a web page. It describes the structure and layout by envisioning elements as boxes comprising content, padding, borders, and margins.

CSS encompasses several properties associated with the box model, including:

Width and Height: These properties determine the dimensions of an element's content area.
Padding: The padding property sets the space between an element's content and its border. It can be adjusted individually for the top, right, bottom, and left sides.
Border: This property defines the appearance of an element's border, allowing customization of its style, thickness, and color.
Margin: The margin property creates space around an element, establishing a gap between adjacent elements. Similar to padding, it can be specified for each side—top, right, bottom, and left.
