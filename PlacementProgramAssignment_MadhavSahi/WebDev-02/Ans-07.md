Q.7 Whatâ€™s Grid & Flex and difference between them?

//Solution--->

Both Grid and Flexbox are CSS layout systems that allow us to create responsive and flexible web layouts.

1. Flexbox:
   - Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is designed for one-dimensional layouts, either in a row or a column.
   - It provides a flexible way to distribute space among items within a container, making it ideal for creating responsive designs, aligning items, and controlling their order.
   - Flexbox focuses on arranging items along a single axis, either horizontally (in a row) or vertically (in a column).
   - It allows us to control the size, alignment, and order of the flex items using properties like flex-direction, justify-content, align-items, and order.

2. Grid:
   - CSS Grid Layout is designed for two-dimensional layouts with rows and columns.
   - It provides a powerful grid-based layout system that allows us to define both the overall grid structure and the placement of items within the grid.
   - Grid allows us to create complex layouts with precise control over rows, columns, and the placement of items.
   - It enables us to define grid tracks, set their sizes, and position items in specific cells or areas using properties like  grid-template-columns ,  grid-template-rows ,  grid-column , and  grid-row .

Differences -
1. Grid and Flexbox differ in their dimensionality. Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system, while Grid is two-dimensional, with rows and columns.
2. Flexbox focuses on arranging items along a single axis, while Grid provides more comprehensive control over both rows and columns, allowing for complex grid-based layouts.
3. Grid offers greater control over the overall grid structure, including item size and placement, while Flexbox emphasizes flexible item distribution within a single axis.
4. Both Grid and Flexbox can be used to create responsive layouts, but Flexbox is typically suitable for smaller-scale designs or for managing alignment and ordering within Grid layouts.
5. Flexbox enjoys better browser support overall, including compatibility with older versions, while Grid may have slightly limited support in older browsers but is well-supported in modern ones.
