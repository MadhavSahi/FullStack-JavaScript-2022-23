Q.2 What are the Different Types of Selectors in CSS & what are the advantages of them?

Solution--->

CSS selectors are used to target and style specific HTML elements. 
Main types of selectors:

1. Type Selectors: Target elements based on their tag name (e.g., h1, p, div). They are simple and easy to use.

2. Class Selectors: Target elements with a specific class attribute value (e.g., .my-class). They promote modularity and reusability.

3. ID Selectors: Target a unique element with a specific ID attribute value (e.g., #my-id). They provide high specificity for individual styling or JavaScript interactions.

4. Attribute Selectors: Target elements based on their attribute values (e.g., [type="text"], [href^="https://"]). They offer flexibility in selecting elements that meet specific criteria.

5. Descendant Selectors: Target elements that are descendants of another element (e.g., div p, ul li). They help style specific elements within nested structures.

6. Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements: Target elements based on states or specific parts (e.g., :hover, :nth-child(2), ::before). They provide dynamic styling and additional effects.

Advantages of using these selectors include specificity for precise targeting, reusability for consistent styles, flexibility in selecting elements, and readability for maintainability.
