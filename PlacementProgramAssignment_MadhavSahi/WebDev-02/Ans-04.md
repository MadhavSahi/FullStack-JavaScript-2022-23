Q.4 Whats difference between Inline, Inline Block and block ?

//Solution--->

The display types inline, inline-block, and block determine how elements are shown and interact with other elements in a document. Here's a summary of each type:

1. Inline:
   - Flows within text content, doesn't start on a new line.
   - Takes up only necessary space for its content.
   - Examples: <span>, <a>, <em>, <strong>.
   - No width, height properties. Margins, paddings, borders affect only horizontal space.
   - No line breaks before or after. Can align text vertically.

2. Inline-block:
   - Similar to inline, but behaves like block-level elements.
   - Flows within text content, can have width, height properties.
   - Respects margins, paddings, borders.
   - Examples: <img>, <input>, <button>.
   - No line breaks before or after, unless additional content on the same line.

3. Block:
   - Starts on a new line, takes up the full available width.
   - Creates a block-level box.
