Q.3 What is VW/VH ?

//Solution--->

Viewport Units (VW/VH):
- VW (viewport width) represents a percentage of the width of the viewport, while VH (viewport height) represents a percentage of the viewport's height.
- These units are relative to the size of the viewport, allowing for responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.
- For example, 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport width, and 1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport height.
- When elements are sized using VW/VH units, their dimensions adjust dynamically as the viewport size changes.
- An example usage is setting an element's width to 50vw, which makes it occupy 50% of the viewport width.

Pixels (px):
- Pixels are absolute units of measurement based on the screen resolution.
- Each pixel represents one physical dot on the screen.
- Pixel values are fixed and do not change with the size of the viewport.
- Elements sized using pixels will maintain the same size regardless of the screen size.
- Setting an element's width to 50px will make it 50 pixels wide, irrespective of the viewport's dimensions.
