//Q.5 What is the difference between let and const in ES6?

//Solution--->

1. Mutability: Variables declared with 'let' are mutable, meaning their values can be changed or reassigned. In contrast, variables declared with 'const' are immutable, and their values cannot be modified once assigned.

2. Initialization: Variables declared with 'let' can be declared without an initial value and assigned later in the code. On the other hand, variables declared with 'const' must be initialized with a value at the time of declaration and cannot be left uninitialized.

3. Scope: Both 'let' and 'const' have block scope, which means they are limited to the nearest enclosing block, such as a function, loop, or conditional statement. They are not accessible outside that block.

4. Hoisting: Variables declared with 'let' and 'const' are hoisted to the top of their block scope, but unlike 'var', they are not initialized until the declaration statement is encountered. Accessing variables before their declaration within the same block leads to the Temporal Dead Zone and results in a 'ReferenceError'.

5. Reassignment: Variables declared with 'let' can be reassigned multiple times within their block scope. However, variables declared with 'const' cannot be reassigned after they are assigned a value. It's important to note that for complex types like objects and arrays assigned to 'const', their properties or elements can still be modified.

6. Best Practices: It is generally recommended to use 'const' for variables that are not intended to be reassigned, as it promotes immutability and makes the code's intent clearer. Use 'let' for variables that need to be reassigned or whose values may change over time.

To summarize, 'let' allows variable reassignment and is suitable for mutable variables, while 'const' enforces immutability and is appropriate for variables that should not be modified. Both 'let' and 'const' have block scope, are hoisted within their scope, and differ in terms of reassignment and initialization requirements.
