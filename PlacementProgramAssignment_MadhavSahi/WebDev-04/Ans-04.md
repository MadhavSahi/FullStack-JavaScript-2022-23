//Q.4 What are the major features introduced in ECMAScript 6?

//Solution--->

1. Block-scoped variables: The introduction of the 'let' and 'const' keywords allows developers to declare variables with block scope, which improves scoping precision and reduces potential issues.

2. Arrow functions: ES6 introduced arrow functions, offering a concise syntax for writing anonymous functions. Arrow functions have a lexically bound 'this' keyword, avoiding common pitfalls related to function scope and 'this' binding.

3. Classes: ES6 brought a standardized class syntax, simplifying the creation of classes and objects using the 'class', 'constructor', and 'extends' keywords. This addition made object-oriented programming in JavaScript more familiar and concise.

4. Modules: ES6 introduced a standardized module system using the 'import' and 'export' keywords, enabling developers to organize code into reusable and maintainable modules. Modules enhance code encapsulation, facilitate dependency management, and improve performance through static analysis.

5. Template literals: Template literals provide a more expressive way to create strings, allowing embedded expressions and multiline strings using backticks (`) instead of single or double quotes. They enhance string manipulation and readability.

6. Enhanced object literals: ES6 enhanced object literals by introducing computed property names, shorthand property and method syntax, and the ability to define object methods without using the 'function' keyword.

7. Destructuring assignment: ES6 introduced destructuring assignment, offering a concise syntax to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables. This simplifies code by eliminating the need for manual value extraction and enables more flexible data manipulation.

8. Promises: Promises became a built-in mechanism for handling asynchronous operations in a structured and intuitive manner. They enable developers to write asynchronous code that is easier to understand, avoiding callback hell and improving error handling.

9. Iterators and generators: ES6 introduced iterators and generators, which provide more flexible and controlled iteration over data structures. Iterators define a standardized way to traverse data, while generators offer a concise syntax for creating iterators.

These are just a few of the significant features introduced in ECMAScript 6. The improvements in ES6 made JavaScript more powerful, expressive, and easier to develop complex applications. Subsequent versions of ECMAScript have continued to build upon these foundations, introducing further enhancements and features to the language.
