Q.4 What is the significance of the "key" prop in React lists, and why is it important to use it correctly?

Solution--->

The "key" prop is a crucial attribute in React that plays a significant role when rendering lists of components. It serves as a unique identifier for each item in the list, allowing React to efficiently track and update individual components.

To use the "key" prop correctly:
- Assign a unique identifier to each item in the list that remains consistent across re-renders.
- Use a value from the item's data that is stable and unique, such as an ID or a unique attribute.
- Avoid using randomly generated keys or index values that may change between renders.

By utilizing the "key" prop correctly, React can efficiently track and update components in lists, leading to better performance and avoiding reconciliation issues. It is essential to understand the significance of "key" props and apply them appropriately when working with dynamic lists in React.
