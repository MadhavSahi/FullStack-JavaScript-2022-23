// Q.6 What are some of the advantages of HTML5 over its previous versions?

// Solution--->

HTML5 is better because of :-

1. Enhanced Multimedia Support: HTML5 introduced built-in support for multimedia elements like <audio> and <video>. This streamlines the integration of multimedia content into web pages, resulting in better performance, broader compatibility across browsers and devices, and an overall improved user experience.

2. Mobile-Friendly and Responsiveness: HTML5 includes features that facilitate the development of mobile-friendly and responsive web designs. It introduced the <canvas> element for graphics rendering and expanded the range of <input> types, enabling developers to create engaging experiences that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.

3. Improved Semantics: HTML5 introduced a range of new semantic elements, such as <header>, <footer>, <nav>, and <article>, which offer a more structured and meaningful way to markup web documents. They make it easier for developers and search engines to understand the content's structure and purpose.
