// Q.9 Whatâ€™s the difference between html tag and attribute and give example of some global attributes?

// Solution--->

HTML Tags:
HTML tags serve as the markup elements utilized to establish the structure and meaning of an HTML document. These tags are enclosed within angle brackets (< >) and consist of the tag name, such as <span>,<table>,<h1>, <p>, <div>, <img>,<figure> and more. HTML tags play a crucial role in indicating the initiation and conclusion of an element or representing stand-alone elements.

HTML Attributes:
On the other hand, HTML attributes are employed within HTML tags to provide supplementary information or configure elements. These attributes are specific to certain HTML tags and modify their behavior, appearance, or functionality. Attributes are specified in the format of key-value pairs within the opening tag of an element, utilizing the attributeName="value" structure. Some examples of attributes include src, href, class, id, alt, style.

Global Attributes:
Global attributes are attributes that can be used with any HTML tag regardless of its specific purpose or meaning. Some examples of global attributes include:

1. class: Specifies one or more CSS class names to apply to an element for styling.
2. id: Provides a unique identifier for an element, allowing it to be targeted by CSS.
3. style: Allows inline styling of an element by specifying CSS rules directly.
