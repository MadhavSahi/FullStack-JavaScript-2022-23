// Q.3 Differentiate between HTML Tags and Elements?

//Solution--->
// HTML Tags:
// HTML tags serve as the markup elements that define the structure and semantics of an HTML document. They are enclosed within angle brackets (< >,</>) and consist of the tag name, such as <h1>,<h6>, <p>, <div>, <img>, etc. These tags are used to mark the beginning and end of an element.

// HTML Elements:
// HTML elements include the HTML tag, its associated attributes, and the content within it. An HTML element is formed by the combination of the opening tag, optional content, and the closing tag. It represents a specific part or component within an HTML document. For instance, in the element <h6> Hello world </h6>, the tag "h6" forms the element, and the angle brackets serve as the tags enclosing the element. The tags hold the elements, and the elements hold the data.
