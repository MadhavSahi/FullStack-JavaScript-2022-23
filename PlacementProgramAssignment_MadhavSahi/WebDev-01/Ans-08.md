// Q.8 What is the difference between <figure> tag and <img> tag?

// Solution--->

The <img> tag is an HTML element used to insert images into a web page. It is a self-closing tag and doesn't require a closing tag. The <img> tag is used to specify the image source, alt text for accessibility, and additional attributes like width and height. It represents a single image in the document.
On the other hand, the <figure> tag serves the purpose of grouping self-contained content blocks, such as images or multimedia objects, along with their respective captions. It provides a semantic structure for the content, making it easier to style and ensure accessibility. The <figure> tag is often used alongside the <figcaption> tag, which provides the caption for the enclosed content.
The difference between <img> tag and the <figure> tag is that the <img> tag is used specifically for inserting standalone images, whereas the <figure> tag is used to group an image or multimedia object together with its caption.
