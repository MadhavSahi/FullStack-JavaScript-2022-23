Q.3 Explain the concept of Breakpoints in Responsive Web Design and How They are used in Media Queries.

//Solution--->

Breakpoints in responsive web design refer to specific screen widths or device sizes where the layout and design of a website need to adapt to ensure optimal display and usability. They define the points at which the content and design elements of a web page are adjusted to accommodate different screen sizes and devices.

Breakpoints are commonly used in conjunction with media queries, which allow you to apply different CSS styles or rules based on the characteristics of the user's device or viewport. By utilizing media queries with breakpoints, you can specify different layouts, adjust font sizes, reposition elements, or modify other styling aspects based on the screen size or device capabilities.

Example:-

/* Default styles for all screen sizes */
body {
  font-size: 16px;
}

/* Styles for screens up to 768px */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  body {
    font-size: 14px;
  }
}

/* Styles for screens between 768px and 1200px */
@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1200px) {
  body {
    font-size: 12px;
  }
}

/* Styles for screens above 1200px */
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
  body {
    font-size: 18px;
  }
}

1. The first media query targets screens with a maximum width of 768px. Within this breakpoint, the font size of the body element is adjusted to 14px.

2. The second media query targets screens with a width between 768px and 1200px. In this range, the font size of the body element is set to 12px.

3. The third media query applies to screens with a minimum width of 1200px. For screens larger than this, the font size of the body element is increased to 18px.
