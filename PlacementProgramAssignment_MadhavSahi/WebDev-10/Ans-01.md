// Q.1 Explain Middlewares in NodeJS ?

Solution--->

In Node.js, middleware refers to a piece of code or a function that sits between the client request and the server response in an application's request-response cycle. It allows you to add additional functionality to your application's HTTP processing pipeline. Middleware functions can intercept incoming requests, perform specific tasks, modify the request or response objects, and invoke the next middleware in the chain.

1. Request-response cycle: When a client makes an HTTP request to a Node.js server, the server processes the request and generates a response. The request-response cycle represents this interaction.

2. Middleware function: A middleware function has access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the `next` function in the application's request-response cycle. It can perform operations on the request, modify the response, or pass control to the next middleware in the chain.

3. Middleware chain: Middleware functions are often organized in a chain, where each function is responsible for a specific task. The `next` function is used to pass control to the next middleware in the chain. This allows multiple middleware functions to process the request and response sequentially.

4. Common middleware tasks: Middleware functions can perform various tasks such as logging, authentication, authorization, data parsing, error handling, routing, and serving static files. They provide a way to modularize and reuse these tasks across different routes or parts of an application.

5. Order of middleware execution: The order in which you define and use middleware functions is important. They are executed in the order they are added to the middleware stack. Middleware functions defined earlier in the stack have a chance to process the request first.

6. Built-in and third-party middleware: Node.js offers built-in middleware modules such as `express.static` for serving static files, `body-parser` for parsing request bodies, and `morgan` for logging. Additionally, there is a wide range of third-party middleware available that can be used to enhance your application's functionality.
