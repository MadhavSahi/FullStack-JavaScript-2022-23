//Q4. What is the use of MongoDB?

Solution--->

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system (DBMS) that is used to store and manage data in a flexible and scalable manner.

1. Document-Oriented: MongoDB is a document oriented database, which means it stores data in a flexible, semi-structured document format (typically JSON-like documents). This allows for easy and dynamic schema design, making it suitable for handling evolving and complex data structures.

2. Scalability and Performance: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, allowing for the distribution of data across multiple servers. It supports automatic sharding, which enables seamless scaling as data volumes and traffic increase. This distributed architecture helps in achieving high performance and handling large amounts of data.

3. Flexibility: MongoDB's flexible schema allows for easy modification and addition of fields within documents. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for agile development environments where requirements may change frequently. It also supports ad-hoc queries, indexing, and powerful aggregation framework for efficient data retrieval and analysis.

4. Replication and High Availability: MongoDB provides built-in replication features, allowing for the creation of multiple copies (replica sets) of data across different servers. This provides high availability and fault tolerance, ensuring that data is accessible even in the event of server failures.

5. Adherence to ACID Principles: While MongoDB is primarily a NoSQL database, it provides support for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions at the document level. This allows for maintaining data consistency and integrity in critical operations.

6. Rich Ecosystem and Community: MongoDB has a large and active community of developers, offering extensive documentation, resources, and support. It also has a rich ecosystem of drivers, tools, and frameworks, making it compatible with various programming languages and platforms.
