//Q2. Why use Express Over NodeJS ?

Solution--->

Express is a web application framework for Node.js, which means it is built on top of Node.JS and provides additional functionality and structure for developing web applications.

1. Simplicity: Express simplifies the process of building web applications in Node.js by providing a high-level framework with built-in features and utilities. It abstracts away many of the low-level details of Node.js, making it easier and faster to develop web applications.

2. Routing and Middleware: Express offers a powerful routing system that allows developers to define routes and handle HTTP requests easily. It also provides middleware support, which enables the application to process requests and responses in a modular and reusable way. Middleware functions can be added to the request/response pipeline to perform various tasks such as authentication, logging, error handling, and more.

3. Flexibility: Express is known for its flexibility and minimalistic approach, allowing developers to customize and configure their application as needed. It does not impose strict conventions, giving developers the freedom to structure their code and choose the libraries and tools they prefer.

4. Large Ecosystem: Express has a vibrant and extensive ecosystem with a wide range of third-party modules and extensions available. These modules provide additional functionality, such as database integration, session management, template engines, and more. The large ecosystem allows developers to leverage existing solutions and reduces the need to reinvent the wheel.

5. Performance: Express is lightweight and optimized for performance. It is designed to handle a large number of concurrent requests efficiently, making it suitable for building scalable and high-performance web applications.
