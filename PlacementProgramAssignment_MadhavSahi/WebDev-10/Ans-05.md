//Q5. What is Mongoose and how does it relate to MongoDB?

Solution--->

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB. It is a wrapper around the MongoDB native driver, which makes it easier to interact with MongoDB from JavaScript. Mongoose provides a number of features that make it easier to develop MongoDB applications, such as schema validation, model inheritance, and query chaining.
Mongoose is an ODM library that provides a higher-level abstraction and additional features to work with MongoDB in a Node.js application. It simplifies the process of defining schemas, performing database operations, enforcing data validation, and managing relationships. Mongoose enhances the functionality and ease of use when interacting with MongoDB,making it a popular choice for Node.js developers working with MongoDB databases.

MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means that data is stored in documents that are similar to JSON objects. Mongoose makes it easy to work with MongoDB documents, as it provides a schema definition language that allows you to define the structure of your documents.

Ease of use: Mongoose makes it easy to interact with MongoDB from JavaScript.

Schema validation: Mongoose provides schema validation, which helps to ensure that the data in your MongoDB database is valid.

Model inheritance: Mongoose supports model inheritance, which allows you to create reusable models.

Query chaining: Mongoose supports query chaining, which makes it easy to perform complex queries.
