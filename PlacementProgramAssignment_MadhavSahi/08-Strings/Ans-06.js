// Question 6**

// Given two strings s and p, return *an array of all the start indices of* p*'s anagrams in* s. You may return the answer in **any order**.

// An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

// **Example 1:**

// **Input:** s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"

// **Output:** [0,6]

// **Explanation:**

// The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".

// The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
