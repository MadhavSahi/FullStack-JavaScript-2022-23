// Question 8**

// Given two strings s and goal, return true *if you can swap two letters in* s *so the result is equal to* goal*, otherwise, return* false*.*

// Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such that i != j and swapping the characters at s[i] and s[j].

// - For example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad".

// **Example 1:**

// **Input:** s = "ab", goal = "ba"

// **Output:** true

// **Explanation:** You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to goal.
