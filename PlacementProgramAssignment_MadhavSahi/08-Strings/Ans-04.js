// Question 4**

// You need to construct a binary tree from a string consisting of parenthesis and integers.

// The whole input represents a binary tree. It contains an integer followed by zero, one or two pairs of parenthesis. The integer represents the root's value and a pair of parenthesis contains a child binary tree with the same structure.
// You always start to construct the **left** child node of the parent first if it exists.
