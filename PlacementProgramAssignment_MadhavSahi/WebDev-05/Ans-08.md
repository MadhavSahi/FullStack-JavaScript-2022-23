//Q.8 Explain Purpose of Try and Catch block

//Solution--->

The purpose of the try and catch blocks in JavaScript is to handle errors and exceptions that occur during the execution of code.

The try block is used to enclose a section of code where an error or exception might occur. It allows you to define a block of code that you want to monitor for any exceptions. If an exception occurs within the try block, the normal flow of execution is interrupted, and the control is transferred to the catch block.

The catch block is used to define the actions that should be taken when an exception is thrown within the corresponding try block. It specifies the code that will be executed to handle the exception and provides an opportunity to gracefully handle errors. The catch block takes an error object as a parameter, which contains information about the exception that was thrown.

Example:-

try {
  // Code that may throw an exception
  const result = someFunction();
  console.log('Result:', result);
} catch (error) {
  // Code to handle the exception
  console.error('An error occurred:', error);
}

In the above example, the try block contains the code that may throw an exception. If an exception occurs during the execution of someFunction(), the control is transferred to the catch block. The error object is caught and can be accessed within the catch block, allowing you to log the error message or perform any necessary error handling.
