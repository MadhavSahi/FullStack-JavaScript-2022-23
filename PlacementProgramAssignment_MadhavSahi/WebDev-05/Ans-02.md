//Q.2 Explain Web Apis

//Solution--->

Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) in JavaScript refer to a collection of functionalities and methods provided by web browsers. These APIs allow developers to interact with various aspects of the web platform, enabling them to create dynamic and interactive web applications. Below are some key Web APIs in JavaScript:

1. DOM API (Document Object Model):
The DOM API enables developers to manipulate HTML and XML documents dynamically. It provides methods and properties to access, modify, and create elements, handle events, change styles, and update the content of web pages.

2. XMLHttpRequest and Fetch API:
These APIs facilitate making HTTP requests from the browser. The XMLHttpRequest API (commonly used in older browsers) and the Fetch API (introduced in newer browsers) allow developers to retrieve data from servers asynchronously. This enables tasks such as fetching data from APIs and updating web content without needing to refresh the entire page.

3. Geolocation API:
The Geolocation API allows web applications to retrieve the user's geographical location if the user grants permission. It provides methods to access latitude, longitude, altitude, and other location-related information. This API is commonly used in location-aware web applications, mapping services, and location-based features.

4. Web Storage API:
The Web Storage API, consisting of localStorage and sessionStorage, provides a way to store data on the client-side. It allows developers to store key-value pairs persistently (localStorage) or temporarily (sessionStorage) within the user's browser. This is useful for caching data, storing user preferences, and maintaining session-specific information.

5. Canvas API:
The Canvas API offers a powerful 2D drawing context that allows developers to generate and manipulate graphics, images, and animations dynamically. It provides methods for drawing shapes, paths, text, and images on a canvas element, enabling the creation of interactive charts, games, and visualizations.

6. Web Audio API:
The Web Audio API enables audio processing and manipulation in web applications. It provides a set of JavaScript objects and methods for creating, controlling, and manipulating audio sources, applying audio effects, and managing audio playback.
