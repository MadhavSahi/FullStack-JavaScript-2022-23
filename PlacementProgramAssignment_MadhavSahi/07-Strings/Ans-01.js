// Question 1**

// Given two strings s and t, *determine if they are isomorphic*.

// Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

// All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

// **Example 1:**

// **Input:** s = "egg", t = "add"

// **Output:** true
