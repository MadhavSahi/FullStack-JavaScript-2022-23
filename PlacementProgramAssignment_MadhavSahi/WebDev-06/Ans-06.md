Q.6 Whats Polymorphism and Purpose of it?

Solution--->

Polymorphism is a crucial concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that enables objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a shared superclass or interface. Its purpose is to enhance code flexibility and reusability by providing a consistent interface to handle objects with varying behaviors and characteristics.

The primary goal of polymorphism is to promote code modularity and adaptability. It allows different objects to respond differently to the same method call based on their specific implementations. Polymorphism allows developers to work with objects at a higher level of abstraction, irrespective of their exact types or internal details.

1. Method overriding: Polymorphism is typically achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides its own implementation of a method defined in its superclass. When a method is called on an object, the overridden method in the subclass is invoked instead of the superclass method, facilitating dynamic behavior.

2. Interface compatibility: Polymorphism can also be attained through interface implementation. Multiple classes can implement the same interface, enabling them to be used interchangeably by code that relies on that interface. This promotes code modularity and allows objects of different classes to be seamlessly utilized.

3. Dynamic dispatch: Polymorphic method calls are resolved at runtime using dynamic dispatch. The appropriate method implementation is determined based on the actual object type, allowing for dynamic behavior and adaptability.

4. Code extensibility: Polymorphism simplifies code extensibility by enabling the addition of new classes to a program without modifying existing code that depends on the shared interface or superclass. Existing code can work with new object types as long as they adhere to the agreed-upon interface or superclass contract.

5. Code flexibility and reuse: Polymorphism enhances code flexibility by enabling objects to exhibit different behaviors while adhering to a common interface or superclass. It promotes code reuse by allowing a single piece of code to operate on multiple object types, minimizing redundancy and improving maintainability.
