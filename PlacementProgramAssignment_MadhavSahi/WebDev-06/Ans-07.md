Q.7  Whats Inheritance and Purpose of it?

Solution--->

Inheritance is a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that enables objects to inherit properties and behaviors from a parent class or superclass. It fosters code reusability, facilitates modular code design, and establishes hierarchical relationships among classes.

1. Class hierarchy: Inheritance establishes a hierarchical structure where subclasses (derived classes) inherit properties and behaviors from a parent class (base class or superclass). This hierarchical relationship can be extended to multiple levels, forming a tree-like structure.

2. Code reuse: Inheritance facilitates code reuse by allowing subclasses to inherit and utilize code from their parent class. This eliminates the need for redundant code and improves code maintenance. Changes made to the parent class automatically propagate to its subclasses.

3. Overriding and extension: Subclasses can override inherited methods from the superclass, providing their own implementations to meet specific requirements. This allows customization and extension of inherited behaviors while maintaining a consistent interface defined by the superclass.

4. Inherited attributes: Subclasses inherit the properties and attributes (member variables) of the superclass, enabling them to access and utilize the inherited data. This promotes code reuse and modular design.

5. Polymorphism: Inheritance is closely associated with polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated uniformly through a shared superclass or interface. This flexibility enhances code adaptability and enables dynamic behavior.
