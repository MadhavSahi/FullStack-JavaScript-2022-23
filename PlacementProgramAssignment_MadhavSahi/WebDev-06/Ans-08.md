Q.8 Whats Encapsulation and Purpose of it ?

Solution--->

Encapsulation is a crucial concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves bundling data and related methods within a single entity called an object. It focuses on data protection and controlled access by limiting direct interaction with the internal state of an object. The primary purpose of encapsulation is to enhance code maintainability, promote information hiding, and ensure data integrity.

1. Data protection: Encapsulation shields the internal state of an object from unauthorized access or modification. By encapsulating data, it prevents direct manipulation and ensures that data is accessed and modified only through well-defined methods.

2. Interfaces for interaction: Encapsulation provides public interfaces, typically methods, through which external code can interact with an object. These interfaces serve as controlled access points to manipulate the encapsulated data, enforcing validation and maintaining consistency.

3. Information hiding: Encapsulation hides the internal implementation details of an object, exposing only the necessary information and functionality. It separates the external interface from the internal workings, reducing dependencies and improving code maintainability.

4. Code organization and modularity: Encapsulation promotes code organization by grouping related data and behavior into cohesive objects. It enables modular design, allowing objects to be developed and modified independently. This enhances code reusability, scalability, and facilitates collaborative development.

5. Levels of encapsulation: Encapsulation can involve different levels of access control, such as public, private, and protected. Public members are accessible from anywhere, private members are restricted to the object itself, and protected members are accessible within the object and its subclasses.

6. Connection to OOP principles: Encapsulation is closely tied to other OOP principles like abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. It supports abstraction by hiding unnecessary details, enables proper inheritance by controlling access to superclass members, and ensures consistent behavior for polymorphic objects.
