Q.5 Whats Abstraction and Its Purpose?

Solution--->

Abstraction is a key concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves simplifying complex systems by focusing on essential features while hiding unnecessary details. Its primary goal is to provide a high-level representation or interface that allows users to interact with objects or systems without being burdened by internal complexities.

The purpose of abstraction is to create models or representations that capture the core aspects of real-world entities or systems, without exposing the intricacies of their implementation. By abstracting away the implementation details, abstraction promotes code modularity, reusability, and adaptability.

1. Essential feature focus: Abstraction filters out non-essential details and emphasizes the most critical characteristics of an object or system. It identifies the fundamental properties, behaviors, and interactions that are relevant to solving a particular problem.

2. Concealing implementation specifics: Abstraction hides the inner workings and complexities of an object or system. It provides a simplified interface or set of methods that enable users to interact with the object without needing to understand its internal implementation.

3. Modularity and reusability: By abstracting implementation details, code can be organized into modular components. These components can be reused in various contexts, promoting code reusability and reducing redundant code.

4. Complexity encapsulation: Abstraction encapsulates complex functionality within an object or system, shielding users from unnecessary complexity. Users can interact with the object through a well-defined interface, abstracting away the intricate implementation specifics.

5. Simplified comprehension and maintenance: Abstraction provides a higher-level understanding of an object or system, making it easier to comprehend and maintain. Developers can work with abstract concepts and interact with objects without requiring in-depth knowledge of every internal component.
