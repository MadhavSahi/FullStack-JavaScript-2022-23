Q.1 Whatâ€™s Constructor And Its Purpose?

Solution--->

Constructor is an essential component in object-oriented programming used to initialize objects of a class. It is invoked during the creation of an instance (object) of a class and is responsible for setting up the initial state of the object by assigning values to its member variables or performing necessary initialization operations.

The primary purpose of a constructor is to ensure that an object is in a valid and usable state before it is utilized. By providing the necessary initialization logic, constructors allow objects to be properly prepared for subsequent operations.

Initialization: Constructors facilitate the initialization of member variables within an object, enabling the assignment of initial values.

Absence of return type: Constructors do not possess a return type, including "void." They focus solely on object initialization rather than returning values.

Overloading: Similar to other methods, constructors can be overloaded. This means that multiple constructors can be defined within a class, each accepting a different set of parameters. This flexibility enables diverse approaches to object initialization.

Default constructor: In situations where no constructors are explicitly defined, many programming languages automatically generate a default constructor. This default constructor either assigns default values to the object or performs no operations if initialization is unnecessary.

Initialization order: Certain programming languages utilize constructors to manage the order in which member variables are initialized. This ensures appropriate handling of dependencies between variables.
