Q.2 Explain This Keyword and Its Purpose?

Solution--->

The `this` keyword is a special element in several programming languages, including JavaScript, designed to reference the current instance of an object. It is primarily used within the scope of an object to access its properties and methods. The purpose of the `this` keyword is to offer a convenient way to specifically denote the object on which a method is being invoked or from which a property is being accessed.

1. Current object reference: When a method is called on an object, the `this` keyword within that method refers to the object itself. This enables the method to interact with and modify the object's properties, as well as invoke other associated methods.

2. Dynamic resolution: The value of the `this` keyword is dynamically resolved during runtime, depending on how the method is invoked. This flexibility allows the same method to operate on different objects, adapting its behavior based on the specific calling context.

3. Usage in constructor functions: In JavaScript, the `this` keyword is widely utilized within constructor functions to refer to the newly created object. It enables the constructor to assign values to the object's properties and execute necessary initialization steps.

4. Event handlers and callbacks: In event-driven programming paradigms, such as JavaScript's event system, the `this` keyword is commonly employed to refer to the object that triggered the event or executed the callback function.

5. Explicit binding: JavaScript also provides explicit methods like `bind()`, `call()`, and `apply()` to explicitly bind the `this` keyword to a particular object. This allows fine-grained control over the execution context of a function and ensures that `this` references the intended object.
