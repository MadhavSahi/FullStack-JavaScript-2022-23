Q.4 Explain OOPS ? 

Solution--->

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that emphasizes structuring code around objects and their interactions. In JavaScript, which is primarily a prototype-based language, OOP concepts can still be applied. Here's a brief explanation of OOP in JavaScript:

1. Objects: In JavaScript, objects are instances of classes or prototypes. They encapsulate data (properties) and behaviors (methods) into a single entity. Objects can be created using the `new` keyword or object literals (`{}`).

2. Classes: Introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), the `class` keyword allows the creation of classes in JavaScript. A class serves as a blueprint for creating objects with predefined properties and methods. It acts as a constructor function and can be used to instantiate multiple object instances.

3. Inheritance: JavaScript supports inheritance through the prototype chain. Objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects, forming a hierarchical relationship. Prototypal inheritance enables code reuse and sharing of behavior between objects.

4. Encapsulation: Encapsulation involves bundling data and related methods within an object, limiting direct access to the internal state. JavaScript provides ways to define public and private members within objects, controlling their visibility and access.

5. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass or interface. JavaScript achieves polymorphism through dynamic typing and duck typing, enabling flexibility and adaptable code.

6. Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on representing essential features while hiding unnecessary complexities. In JavaScript, objects, classes, and interfaces can be used to achieve abstraction, providing simplified and high-level concepts.

7. Object Composition: JavaScript promotes object composition, where objects can be composed of other objects to achieve complex functionalities. This approach allows for flexible object structures and modular design.
